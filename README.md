I’m excited to share that I’ve successfully completed the DataCamp Competition focused on analyzing and visualizing global internet usage trends from 2000-2023 🌍💻. As part of the challenge, I built an interactive Dashboard that tracks the **Year-over-Year (YoY) Changes**, **Geographical Distribution**, and **Growth Rate** of internet usage across countries. The solution provides meaningful insights into how internet penetration has evolved over time 🌐📈.

### 🔑 **Key Highlights of the Dashboard:**
- **Growth Rate Overview** - Analyzes the overall growth of internet usage globally.
- **Trend Analysis** - Visualizes internet usage trends over time for each country.
- **Geographical Distribution** - Displays internet usage by country in 2023.
- **Year-over-Year (YoY) Change** - Highlights which countries had the largest growth in internet usage.

I'm thrilled to have had the opportunity to work on this project and improve my data analysis and visualization skills. This experience has helped me gain valuable insights into the world of global internet usage trends and further strengthened my expertise in using tools like **Looker Studio** and **Python** for data analysis and reporting.

### 🔍 **Takeaways:**
- Hands-on experience with data visualization tools 🛠️
- Understanding the impact of internet usage across various countries 🌍
- Ability to present data in a clear and actionable format 📊
